00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
I thought love was only true in fairy tales

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Meant for someone else but not for me

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Love was out to get me

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
That's the way it seemed

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
Not a trace of doubt in my mind

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
I'm in love, mmm-oh

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
I thought love was more or less a giving thing

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
The more I gave the less I got oh yeah

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
What's the use in tryin'

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
All you get is pain

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
When I wanted sunshine I got rain

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm in love, mmm-oh

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Love was out to get me

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Thatâ€™s the way it seems

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm in love, mmm-oh

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000

Yes, I saw her face

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Now I'm a believer

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
